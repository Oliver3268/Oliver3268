### Oliver Gladys
I am a Computer Science Graduate from the University of Pittsburgh.  I am currently looking to start my professional career in entry level positions related to Software Development, Software Engineering, Web Development, and other tech related positions.  I have a solid academic foundation in data structures, 
algorithms, and software design, complemented by practical experience in Java, Python, and web development. I have a proven ability to adapt quickly and 
contribute to team-oriented projects.
